Contact us: +1 (800) 425-1267 Accessibility Commitment to Accessibility At Okta, our mission is to create a world of technology where everyone can use it safely, regardless of ability. We aim to design, develop, and test our products with accessibility in mind so that all individuals can use them as intended. We recognize that accessibility can be obtained by following industry standards, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA. In attempting to meet the highest levels for design quality and excellence, we partner with a third-party accessibility testing service and listen to our customers' feedback to improve our products. Our dedication to accessibility is reflected in what we do, from employee awareness opportunities to building best practices for accessible product development. We offer public Accessibility Compliance Reports (ACRs) and invest in an open-source design system called Odyssey , enabling builders to create beautiful, consistent and accessible product experiences. While we aspire to make everything we build accessible to all, we understand the road to a completely accessible world is long and we still have much to learn.
